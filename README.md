# Generalized Adaptive Refinement for Grid-based Hexahedral Meshing

This is the code we used for the experiments in the paper "**Generalized Adaptive Refinement for Grid-based Hexahedral Meshing**" by L. Pitzalis, [M. Livesu](http://pers.ge.imati.cnr.it/livesu/), [G. Cherchi](http://www.gianmarcocherchi.com), [R. Scateni](https://people.unica.it/riccardoscateni/) and [E. Gobbetti](https://www.crs4.it/it/peopledetails/8/enrico-gobbetti/) (ACM TOG, SIGGRAPH Asia 2021).

|:warning: The code will be available soon |
